      "AI is a technological marvel, one that might beat your imagination. However, we need to understand that this technological marvel has been made possible by the application of human intelligence. Thus, AI, while powerful, should be viewed as a tool that complements and enhances human intelligence rather than a direct replacement. The collaborative potential of AI and human intelligence holds immense promise for addressing complex challenges and driving innovation in various domains.\n",

      " Introduction \n",
      "In this write-up, I attempt to provide a clear perspective on AI as a technology that enhances rather than replaces human intelligence. I further attempt to debunk the myth that AI is a direct replica of human cognitive processes, instead portraying AI as reliant on machine learning techniques. AI’s perceived threat to human existence by over-powering our intelligence is primarily founded on a lack of understanding of what AI is and how it works. Though we often describe AI as mimicking human intelligence, it is important to note that AI does not directly replicate or mimic human cognitive abilities. While AI systems can perform tasks like solving problems, language processing, and making decisions that mimic human reasoning, they do so through machine learning capabilities rather than biological cognitive processes. Lately, AI has become the buzzword in a world heavily influenced by digital technology. AI is nothing new; this technology has been used for decades. From the conceptualisation of machine intelligence with the Turing test to the coining of the term AI by John McCarthy, AI development has seen a massive boost in recent years. The application of AI technologies permeates areas such as manufacturing, health, media, and education. AI has proven to have great prospects despite the worries and concerns which are genuine. Among these concerns is the misconception that AI will supersede human intelligence. First, understanding AI requires demystifying the myth that “AI is a superimposition of human cognitive abilities.” Coming to terms with this fact begins with understanding the concept of intelligence and the rationale behind the reference point of intelligence.\n",
